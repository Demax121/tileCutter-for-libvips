This is a simple batch file I have created to automate creating map tiles for google maps and leafletJS.
Put this tileCutter folder directly into the libvips library (not in bin, outside of it).
Throw some inmages into images folder and run the script, you will have a simple menu that will show you your files and will let you which one you want to process.

All tiles are in .WEBP format with a black background, the tile size is 256x256 witch google layout.

Disclaimer: If you want to use those tiles with leafletJS, you have to change in your javascript files hierarchy from {z}/{x}/{y} to {z}/{y}/{x}.
